Insert -

->Push the value into the values property on the heap.
->Bubble up.
    -Create a variable called index which is the length of values property -1.
    -Create a variable called parent index which is the floow of (index - 1)/2.
    -Keep looping as long as the values element at the parent index is less than
    the values element at the child index.
        =- Swap the value of the values element at the parent index with the value
        of the element property at the child index.
        =- Set the index to be the parent index, start over!

Removing(Extract max)-

->Swap the first value in the values property with the last one.
->Pop from the values property, so you can return the value at the end.
->Have the new root sink down to correct spot.
    -Your parent index starts at 0(the root).
    -Find the index of the left child: 2 * index + 1.(make sure its not out of bounds)
    -Find the index of the right child: 2 * index + 2(make sure its not out of bounds).
    -If left or right child is greater than the element swap. If both left and right
    children are larger, swap with the largest child.
    -The child index you swapped to now becomes the new parent index.
    -Keep looping and swapping until neither child is larger than the element.
->Return the old root.
