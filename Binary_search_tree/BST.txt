Insert(Iteratively or Recursively) -
->Create a new node.
->Starting at the root.
    -Check if there is a root, if not the root now becomes that new node.
    -If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is greater than or less than
    the value of root.
    -If it is greater-
        -Check to see if there is a node to the right.
        -If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps.
        -If there is not, add that node as the right property.
    -If it is less-
        -Check to see if there is a node to left.
        -If there is, move to that node and repeat these steps.
        -If there is not, add that node as the left property.

Finding a node in BST-
->Starting at root.
    -Check if there is a root, if not-we're done searching.
    -If there is a root, check if the value of the new node is the value we are looking for.
    If we found it, we're done.
    -If not, check to see if the value is greater than or less than the value of the root.
    -If it is greater-
        -Check to see if there is a node to the right.
