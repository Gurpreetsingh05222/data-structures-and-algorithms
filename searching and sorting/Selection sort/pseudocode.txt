Pseudocode for Selection sort -
->Store the first element as the smallest value you've seen so far.
->Compare this item to the next item in the array until tou find a smaller number.
->If a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new "minimum"
and continue until the end of array.
->If the minimum is notthe value (index) you initially began with swap the two values.
->Repeat this with next element until the array is sorted.
